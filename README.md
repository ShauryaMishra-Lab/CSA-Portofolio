# CSA Portfolio

A React portfolio website for Shaurya Mishra, built for Computer Science Application. The site presents a competitive golfer and developer identity with animated visuals, resume content, project documentation areas, and two project features.

Live site:

- [GitHub Pages Portfolio](https://shauryamishra-lab.github.io/CSA-Portofolio/)

## Theme

The portfolio is designed around the connection between competitive golf and computer science:

- Golf brings focus, patience, resilience, and performance under pressure.
- Computer science brings structure, debugging, data, logic, and project building.
- The design uses fairway greens, warm golds, motion, project cards, and a real golf-course photo to make that identity clear.

## Featured Projects

### F1 Race Trace

A Python data visualization project that uses FastF1 race telemetry for the 2021 Bahrain Grand Prix.

It loads lap data, calculates each driver's gap to the race leader by lap, exports a CSV file, and creates a PNG line chart showing race progress.

### Java Inheritance Program

A Java object-oriented programming project focused on superclass and subclass relationships.

It demonstrates how inheritance can reduce repeated code, organize related classes, and make a program easier to extend and explain through a UML-style structure.

## Built With

- React
- Vite
- JavaScript / JSX
- CSS
- Lucide React icons

## Run Locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project deploys automatically with GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to `main`.

The workflow builds the Vite app into `dist/` and publishes that folder to GitHub Pages. The production Vite base path is configured as `/CSA-Portofolio/` so the built `index.html` loads the JavaScript, CSS, and image assets correctly from the repository Pages URL.
